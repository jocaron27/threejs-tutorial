# Senior Enrichment Project

Make a thing!

## Getting started

1. Fork and clone this repo
2. *Set the name of your project in `package.json`*. The skeleton intentionally ships with an invalid name.
3. `npm install`
4. Check out the mock-view in the `wireframes` folder
5. Start the build process with: `npm run build-watch`
6. In another terminal, start your app with `npm start`
7. If you navigate to the URL you should see some UI already :) [We already have some connection code to get you started]

## Requirements

### The Premise

You are the CTO of the Margaret Hamilton Interplanetary Academy of JavaScript. Create a RESTful web platform that allows you to manage your students and campuses.

### The tools

Use at least sequelize, express, react, and redux when creating this app. You can incorporate any additional libraries or tools you wish.

### DB Design

- Students
  * have profile info (e.g. name and email)
  * must be assigned to a campus

- Campuses
  * have info such as a name and image
  * can have many students assigned (may have none)

### Views and Functionality
#### See Wireframes folder for visual

- Navigation: as a user I...
  * will land on **Home** by default
  * can navigate to **Campuses** from **Home**
  * can navigate to **Students** from **Home**
  * can navigate to view a **Single Campus** from **Campuses**
  * can navigate to view a **Single Student** from **Students**
  * can navigate to view a **Single Student** from **Single Campus** (for any student at that campus)
  * can navigate to view that student's **Single Campus** from **Single Student**

- Views: as a user I...
  * see a list of all campuses on the **Campuses** view
  * see a list of all students on the **Students** view
  * see details about a campus on the **Single Campus** view, including that campus's students
  * see details about a student on the **Single Student** view, including that student's campus

- Actions: as a user I...
  * can create a campus
  * can edit a campus's info, including adding/removing a student to/from that campus
  * can delete a campus
  * can create a student
  * can edit a student's info, including the campus that student is assigned to
  * can delete a student

### Routes

```
GET
- all campuses
- a campus by id
- all students
- a student by id
```

```
POST
- new campus
- new student
```

```
PUT
- updated student info for one student
- updated campus info for one campus
```

```
DELETE
- a campus
- a student
```

### How to test functionality without a frontend
- GET: use your browser
- POST / PUT / DELETE : 
 - CLI (command line interface) with `curl`
   - e.g. `curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"username":"kate","password":"1234"}' http://localhost:3000/api/login`
   - `-H`: headers. `-X`: verb. `-d`: data (must be of the type specified in headers). http://[address]:[port]/[route_path]
 - [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)

- Databases: use Sequelize in your routes and see if you are receiving what you expect

### Video Walkthrough
Please submit a 3-minute screencast of a walk-through of the functionality *and code* for each user story in your app. E.g. for "As a user, I can create a campus", please show us that you can successfully create a campus in your app, and also the actual code that is involved in doing that (from the front-end components to the backend routes and models). We recommend using Quicktime to record the screencast (instructions on how to do that [here](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH5882?locale=en_US&viewlocale=en_US)).

Once you've recorded your screencast, please *upload it to YouTube as an unlisted video*, and send us the link. This will aid us in evaluating your submission.

## Evaluation
